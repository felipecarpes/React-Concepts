# React-Concepts

In this application, we developed a similar interface with Facebook,
Using the following tools:
Webpack
Webpack-dev-server
Babel
ReactJS 

And we use some React concepts, such as:

Structure of project
Class Components
State and immutability
React Properties
Default Props
PropTypes
Life cycle of components
How to import CSS and Image

The information contained in the interface is static and need not reflect any REST API or backend.
